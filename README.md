This is a simple use case showing how you would use jquery datatables in a react project, with out having to worry about the conflict between jquery and react.

##Justification
With all the warnings out there against using jquery and react together, why would someone ever want to do this.
1. First after searching on the internet for a good datatable to use react, i can somewhat say there aren any viable alternatives.
 some are either too bulky, too buggy or the libraries are extinct.

2. Jquery-datatables has been around since like forever, and such a battle tested tool will normally cover things that new libraries have not yet even discovered. Things like true responsiveness, (not just a horizontal scroll), Proper data export, printing, and seamless integration with styling libraries. And ofcourse jquery-datatables has a fantastic api and documentation.

So until I find a good implementation of a datatable in react, this hack will for now do the job, and it does it really well
